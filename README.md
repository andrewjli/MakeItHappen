=========

This is a web platform made at HackKings 2014, intended to fill a niche for developers who need to gain experience and build a portfolio, but don't have the qualifications (and portfolio) to get an internship/job. Companies unwilling to fund risky ideas, researchers, academics, individuals without technical skills can propose small projects for these developers to develop, and all parties stand to gain something from this.

This repository is a personal copy of the original repository which is located at [nkp/hackkings](https://github.com/nkp/hackkings).
